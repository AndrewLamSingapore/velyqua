# VELYQUA Architecture Decisions

**Status:** Active VELYQUA 2.0 direction + 21 August 2026 inference extension

This document separates current implementation from intended architecture. A target decision is not a claim that migration is complete. `SSOT.md` defines precedence; `src/os/capabilities.ts` defines current delivery status.

## Core architecture decisions

### ADR-001: iPhone-first React Native
Use React Native, Expo and TypeScript for the first production client. Preserve native-quality iPhone interaction/accessibility; later portability is not a parity promise.

### ADR-002: Local-first writes
A confirmed update must be durable locally before network completion. Stronger persistence migrations must be versioned, tested and non-destructive. No acknowledged observation may disappear.

### ADR-003: Server-enforced owner isolation
Use founder-controlled Supabase/infrastructure with RLS/server authorization, least privilege, no private service key in the mobile bundle, separated environments and cross-account tests.

### ADR-004: Deterministic, versioned decision rules
Product state and safety-relevant recommendations come from reviewed deterministic rules, not a language model. Evaluations preserve exact inputs, units, freshness/confidence, rule/evidence revision, result, limitations and historical replay.

### ADR-005: Bounded AI
AI may parse input into reviewable drafts, explain approved results and integrate evidence. It may not create authoritative facts, invent safety thresholds, bypass missing-data states, diagnose disease, prescribe treatment or take consequential physical action.

### ADR-006: Private media
Photographs are private owner observations, never laboratory measurements. Strip location metadata and use owner-scoped access. Real owner media is not demo/training material without explicit revocable permission.

### ADR-007: Conflict and correction
Append-only observations preserve distinct operation IDs; corrections create revisions; unsafe merges surface both values; historical rule/knowledge revisions remain replayable.

### ADR-008: Provenance and replay
Every observation stores source, occurred/recorded time, method, original/canonical value and unit, confirmation and revision. Derived values never overwrite raw observations. Recommendations are replayable from snapshots and rule revisions.

### ADR-009: Founder-owned accounts
GitHub, Apple, Expo/EAS, Supabase, domain, design, monitoring and support accounts remain under founder control; collaborators receive least privilege.

### ADR-010: Cross-parameter biological inference
VELYQUA may derive reviewed biological-risk interpretations from multiple observations when the relationship is scientifically defensible, versioned, testable, provenance-preserving and subordinate to deterministic safety governance.

First approved specification: `AMMONIA_TOXICITY_FUSION_V1.md`.

`reference total ammonia + trusted pH + trusted temperature + freshness/provenance -> derived NH3 interpretation -> governed risk/action`

Raw inputs remain distinct from derived state; calculation revision and exact inputs are replayable; units/reporting conventions are explicit; stale/contradictory inputs reduce support and may require re-test; an aging ammonia observation is never silently asserted as current; higher-tier livestock/water/oxygen safety overrides remain intact; AI cannot choose unsupported chemistry/toxicity thresholds.

This ADR authorizes the architecture for reviewed cross-parameter inference, not every proposed relationship.

### ADR-011: Optional edge/sensor architecture
The complete MVP remains manual-first and works without sensors. If validated hardware is connected later, the edge layer may own acquisition, timestamping, basic calibration, quality/failure flags, buffering and elementary deterministic offline hazard rules. Higher-level services own history-dependent inference, confidence fusion and forecasting.

Sensor integration remains read-side unless a future controlled decision explicitly changes the hard exclusion on automatic equipment control.

### ADR-012: Relational and temporal sensor fusion
Prototype inference must model observations as a time-linked evidence system rather than a collection of independent gauges. Candidate predictors may include raw values, deltas, rates of change, cross-parameter relationships, temporal ordering, intervention history, tank baseline, reference chemistry and measurement-quality/provenance features.

No proxy may be silently promoted into the analyte or biological state it merely correlates with. In particular, conductivity/TDS is not ammonia, pH is not water quality, and correlation is not causation.

The experimental architecture must support comparison between at least:

1. a periodic/reference-testing baseline; and
2. a low-cost fusion model using continuous observations plus available reference chemistry, context and history.

Evaluation must preserve prospective or otherwise leakage-controlled separation between predictor information and later ground truth. Candidate relationships are judged by early-warning lead time, false alarms, misses, confidence calibration, robustness to normal interventions/confounders and incremental information gain. Hardware additions should be justified by measured incremental information rather than parameter importance alone.

Continuous ammonia sensing is therefore not a prerequisite for the first prototype. Periodic/reference ammonia may serve as ground truth or a label while cheaper continuous observables test whether useful predictive structure exists. This is an experimental choice, not a claim that pH, conductivity/TDS or temperature can directly measure ammonia.

## Architecture boundaries

- Freshwater launch only.
- Manual entry complete without sensors.
- Sensor/controller adapters optional read paths, not automatic control.
- Fish Passport, QR identity, ownership ledger and marketplace remain excluded.
- Disease diagnosis and medication prescription remain excluded.
- Simulations are immutable branches and never actual history automatically.
- `src/os/capabilities.ts` governs current delivery status.
