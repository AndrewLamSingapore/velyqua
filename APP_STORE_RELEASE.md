# VELYQUA 0.3 — TestFlight and App Store release checklist

The source is release-candidate ready when `npm run release:check` passes. A real TestFlight build still requires the owner-controlled Supabase, Expo and Apple accounts described in `SETUP_SIMPLE.md`.

## Identity-transition gate

Complete these checks before inviting any external tester. A repository rename does not migrate account-bound services or data.

- [ ] Confirm whether any Apple/App Store record exists under the retired bundle identifier; migrate or formally retire it
- [ ] Confirm the VELYQUA Expo/EAS project identity and ownership
- [ ] Confirm Supabase authentication redirects accept `velyqua://**` and remove retired redirects only after recovery is unnecessary
- [ ] Inventory founder/test-device data created under earlier identifiers and document whether it is migrated, exported or intentionally retired
- [ ] Record the decision and evidence in the release log; do not infer completion from source CI

## Required owner setup

- [ ] Supabase production project created in the owner's account
- [ ] SQL migration run once without errors
- [ ] `delete-account` Edge Function deployed and tested
- [ ] `velyqua://**` allowed as an authentication redirect
- [ ] Expo project created in the owner's account with `eas init`
- [ ] Production Supabase URL and publishable key stored as EAS environment variables
- [ ] Apple Developer membership active
- [ ] App Store Connect record owns bundle ID `com.andrewlamsingapore.velyqua`
- [ ] Agreements, tax and banking sections completed if Apple requests them

## Real-device acceptance test

- [ ] Create, confirm, sign in, reset password and sign out
- [ ] Add all supported manual water-test types
- [ ] Add an observation and verify Tank Memory
- [ ] Save offline, reconnect and confirm cloud synchronisation
- [ ] Create independent logs on two devices and confirm both remain
- [ ] Export JSON data and open the file
- [ ] Delete a test account in the app and confirm sign-in no longer works
- [ ] Verify every button, deep link and empty/error state
- [ ] Test VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, contrast and keyboard behaviour on a real iPhone
- [ ] Confirm there are no crashes or lost records during interruption tests

## Apple review material

Create a dedicated reviewer account in the production Supabase project. Do not reuse the owner's personal account. Populate it with the included realistic starter aquarium and several dated manual tests. Put the exact credentials in App Review Information in App Store Connect.

Suggested review notes:

> VELYQUA is a compiled React Native iOS app for manually maintaining a private freshwater aquarium history. An account is required because private cloud synchronisation between devices is a core feature. The supplied review account contains a realistic sample aquarium. To test offline-first storage, disable connectivity, add a water test through Quick Update, then reconnect; the header changes from “Offline · safe on this phone” to “Saved on phone + cloud.” Permanent account deletion and JSON export are under Owner account. VELYQUA provides decision support, does not diagnose disease and labels simulations as estimates.

## App Store Connect metadata

- **Privacy policy URL:** `https://github.com/AndrewLamSingapore/velyqua/blob/main/PRIVACY.md`
- **Support URL:** `https://github.com/AndrewLamSingapore/velyqua`
- Complete Apple's App Privacy answers from the production configuration; do not guess.
- Upload screenshots captured from the actual release build, not design mock-ups.
- Explain any authentication email delay or regional limitation in Review Notes.

## Release decision

Do not invite external testers or submit for App Review while any required or real-device item above is unchecked. Source checks cannot replace testing on the owner's real backend and iPhone.
